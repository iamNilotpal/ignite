# ignite - A High-Throughput In-Memory Key-Value Store

`ignite` is a Go package that implements a high-throughput, in-memory key-value
data store inspired by Bitcask. It is designed for applications requiring fast
read and write operations, such as caching, session management, and real-time
data processing. The goal is to provide a simple, efficient, and reliable
solution for in-memory data storage in Go applications.
