# Compiled binaries (relative to the package)
# For example, if your main package is in the root, ignore the binary name
# Add your specific BINARY_NAME here if it's different or in a subdirectory
# Example based on the Makefile:
dist
# If your binary is generated elsewhere, add its path, e.g.:
# bin/

# Output directory for cross-compiled binaries from the Makefile
/dist/

# Go build cache
# This is typically outside the project, but adding it here doesn't hurt
# and can prevent accidental commits if GOARCH/GOOS tricks create local caches.
# $(go env GOCACHE)

# Ignore Go modules cache directory if present in project root (shouldn't be standard)
